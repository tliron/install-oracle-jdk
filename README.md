# Install Oracle JDK

Straightforward shell script to install Oracle's JDK. I try to keep it up to date with the latest and greatest.

Tested in Ubuntu.

I know there are other solutions, but this one works well for me. Maybe you will like it, too.

You need `java-common` to be installed for `update-java-alternatives` to work.
